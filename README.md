# Dataline Sport - Main theme for Front-end

Designed to provide more reactive experience for Dataline's sport websites. From fans to fans. We have developed our sports platform together with sports clubs, mostly with Joensuu Kiekkopojat, Kiekko-Vantaa and RoKi Hockey.

The website has a lot of special features that would not normally be possible to implement with a PHP theme. We strive to provide the best possible experience for visitors while offering new features each year.

The creator and main developer is [Timo Anttila](https://github.com/timoanttila), [Tuspe Design Oy](https://tuspe.com/) & Dataline Group Oy.  
All rights and codes are owned by Dataline Group Oy.
